Iolaus is an opinionated versioning system built to support large monorepos using `lerna` with independently versioned sub-components. Named after the hero who assisted Heracles in the fight against the Hydra of Lerna.

## How it Works

1. uses your existing `lerna` configuration to find all packages in your repo
1. looks back in history to find all commits since your latest release on github
1. creates a list of packages which should update, and the semantically correct verions to bump them to along
1. commits the updated versions and updated dependencies along with a changelog for the changed packages
1. creates appropriate github releases
1. creates appropriate npm releases

## Getting Started

Install `iolaus` a dev dependency in your project as well as `lerna` and `semantic-release` which it relies on to run.

```sh
npm install -D iolaus lerna semantic-release
# or
yarn add -D iolaus lerna semantic-release
```

Add a release script to your `package.json`.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "release": "iolaus"
  }
}
```

Now you can simply run the `release` script in your CI whenever you want to check for and then perform a release.
Note that releases will only be generated when it is required based on analysis of commit messages.

### Formatting Commit Messages

Commit messages must indicate whether a `patch`, `minor` or `major` release needs to occur to satisfy semantic versioning.
They also have to specify which packages are affected by the commit.

To accomplish this we currently support the format generated by `commitizen` when using the `cz-lerna-changelog` plugin.
See the [`commitizen` documentation](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) for how to add it to your workflow.

### Environment Variables

In order to authenticate with Github and npm you need to supply the following environment variables.

- `NPM_TOKEN`: the token used for authenticating with `npm` to release packages
- `GH_TOKEN`: a github token with repo privelages for pushing commits and tags generated during release

## Configuration

You can provide configuration for `iolaus` using a configuration file like `.iolausrc`, `.iolausrc.yml` or anything supported by [`cosmiconfig`](http://npm.im/cosmiconfig).

### Configuration Options

- `branch`: the branch to run a release on, defaults to `'master'`
- `dryRun`: if `true` then the release will be skipped, but tags will be generated and `CHANGELOG.md` and `package.json`'s updated
- `npmRegistry`: the `npm` registry to push to, defaults to `'https://registry.npmjs.org/'`
- `releaseAssets`: an array of file globs for files to include as release assets, defaults to `[]`

## CLI Arguments

When running `iolaus` you can pass a number of flags to change its functionality.

- `--config`, `-c`: the configuration file to read from, otherwise uses `cosmiconfig` to search from the working directory
- `--branch`, `-b`: the branch to run a release on, defaults to `'master'`
- `--registry`, `-r`: the `npm` registry to push to, defaults to `'https://registry.npmjs.org/'`
- `--dry-run`, `-d`: if `true` then the release will be skipped, but tags will be generated and `CHANGELOG.md` and `package.json`'s updated
